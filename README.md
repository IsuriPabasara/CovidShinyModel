# Covid-19 Epidemic Modeling with R Shiny
This is a shiny app that models the COVID-19 epidemic. This is based on the <a href="http://penn-chime.phl.io/">Penn Chime app</a> - all credit goes to the Penn Medicine and Code for Philly team for their idea. 

A beta version of the app is live <a href="https://jpspeng.shinyapps.io/COVIDModel/">here</a>.
